              I have some web dev experience from making 2 simple websites,
              although it was over a year ago, so I need to refresh everything.
              I've never gone in-depth into web dev.

              I've had a great experience with the course so far. I like that
              the lectures are recorded, and the textbook is a great resource.
              I'm happy about the new portfolio design because after messing
              around with many tools, I went back to focus more on an aesthetic
              appeal. Removing many things and making the website more simple. I
              feel pretty comfortable designing web pages, but the hardest part
              so far has been flex-boxes. What I'm hoping to see in the future
              is how to make the website more dynamic with
              animations/transitions, or how we can create a website connected
              to a database.

              Fixed the homepage and made it the same design as the rest of the
              website. As a team, we talked about updating the style of the
              website as we didn't like how boxy and separated everything felt.
              Also discussed changing the colors to be more simple.

              JS has been more challenging than HTML and CSS, and it's taking
              more time to understand and remember how to do certain things with
              it. Any prior experience sort of helps with loops and storing
              things, although the syntax is different. The most interesting
              part about JS is how much control we have over the things we can
              do for the user. The most difficult part for me so far is
              remembering how to do things.
