            never went zin-depth into web dev.

            I've had a great experince with the course so far. I like that the
            lecutres are recorded, and the textbook is a great resource.
            I'm happy about the new portfolio design because after messing
            around with a lot of tools, I went back to focus more on an aesthetic appeal.
            Removing many things and making the webiste more simple. I feel pretty comfortable desiging
            web pages, but the hardest part so far has been flex-boxes. What I'm
            hoping to see in the future is how to make the website more dynamic
            with animations/transtions, or how we can create a website connected to a database.

              Fixed the homepage and made it the same desing as the rest of the website. As a team we talked about
              updating the style of the webiste as we didn't like how boxy and seperated everyhting felt. Also discussed
              changing the colors to be more simple.
